# Rock paper scissors

## What is this game about?
This repository is for my first personal project, where you play the classic game of Rock, paper and scissors.
You have an assistant called Rupert that will talk to you and introduce you to the RPS (rock, paper and scissors) System.

## How does it work?
There are four different leves and each level has a different mechanism. You play against an AI that tries to predict your next movement and beat you.

## How to play:
If you want to play the game and try it yourself, just clone this repository using the link below and have fun!
